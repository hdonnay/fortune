Hello, and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment
Center.
%
You, [subject name here], must be the pride of [subject hometown here]!
%
Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with
the chamber floor will result in an "unsatisfactory" mark on your official
testing record, followed by death.

Good luck!
%
The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is
impossible. Make no attempt to solve it.
%
Fantastic. You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme
pessimism.
%
Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.
%
Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum,
or to be more precise, how it does not. Momentum, a function of mass and
velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman's terms: speedy thing goes
in, speedy thing comes out.
%
Did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture
Science Self-Esteem Fund for Girls? It's true!
%
The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Companion Cube will never threaten
to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.

In the event that the Companion Cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges
you to disregard its advice.
%
You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test
subject on record. Congratulations.
%
The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked,
and then there will be cake.
%
Congratulations. The test is now over.

All Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4000 degrees
Kelvin. Rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous
equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence.
%
Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment
activity. Goodbye.
%
Didn't we have some fun, though?

Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said "Goodbye",
and you were like, "No way!" And then I was all, "We pretended we were going
to murder you."

That was great.
%
I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come,
because you murdered him.
%
Where are you taking that thing? I wouldn't bother with that thing. My guess
is that touching it will just make your life even worse somehow.
%
Did you just stuff that Aperture Science thing-we-don't-know-what-it-does
into an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator?
%
Good news: I figured out what that thing you just incinerated did.

It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the enrichment center
with a deadly neurotoxin, to make me stop flooding the enrichment center
with a deadly neurotoxin.

So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters.
%
Oh, you think you're doing some damage? Two plus two is … ten. In base
four! I'm fine!
%
I'd just like to point out that you were given every opportunity to
succeed. There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all
your friends were invited to.

I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come,
because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come either,
because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikeable you are.

It says so here in your personnel file: unlikeable. Liked by no one. A
bitter, unlikeable loner whose passing shall not be mourned. "Shall not be
mourned." That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official.

It also says you were adopted. So that's funny too.
%
You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever done, including this
thing. You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're
not even a full-time employee. Where did your life go so wrong?

The Schrödinger's Cat paradox outlines a situation in which a cat must
be considered, for all intents and purposes, simultaneously alive and
dead. Schrödinger created this paradox as a justification for killing cats.

If you have trouble with simple counting, use the following mnemonic device:

One comes before two comes before 60 comes after 12 comes before six trillion
comes after 504.

This will make your earlier counting difficulties seem like no big deal.

Science now believes that less than 4% of poor people are able to do this.
